🧠 TaskSync – When Task Management Meets Emotional Awareness

I used to feel that most to-do apps are... robotic.
They help you plan, but they don’t reflect how you feel or how your energy flows.

So I built TaskSync — a personal task manager that not only tracks your tasks,
but helps you understand your emotional momentum throughout the week.

🌗 It connects your actions → to energy → to reflection.
📊 Each task contributes to a live Emotional Meter (moderate? burnout? high flow?)
🌀 It’s designed to feel intuitive – no manual needed.
🧩 Inspired by Apple-level simplicity, and will soon integrate with my next app: Sorola (a deeper life-path planning system).

🔧 Tech stack:

Next.js 15

I’m building this as a solo dev to push UX, productivity, and emotion-aware tools forward.
Would love feedback or collabs from anyone building in the human-centered tech space.
